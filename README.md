# 🚀 ishrath's Journey to Generative AI

Hi there! 👋  
I'm ishrath, and this repository captures my **complete learning path** towards mastering **Generative AI** — from foundational coding skills to advanced model development. 🧠✨

---

## 🌱 Current Step: Python OOP Basics
> Before diving into AI, it's crucial to build strong programming fundamentals.  
That's why I'm starting by mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.



## 📚 Topics I'm Learning
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

  

## 🛠️ Mini OOP Projects

| Bank System | Simulates banking operations using classes | [simple_bank_system.py](./projects/simple_bank_system.py) |
| Student Management System | Manage student records with OOP | [student_management_system.py](./projects/student_management_system.py) |



## 🚀 Next Steps
- Build OOP mini-projects ✅
- Learn Advanced Python (Decorators, Generators, Context Managers)
- Dive into NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- Start studying Deep Learning Fundamentals
- Implement basic GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)



## 📚 Resources
- [Python OOP Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

## 🌟 About Me
I'm a passionate learner documenting my path into **Generative AI**.  
This repo is my way of learning in public, reflecting, and growing! 🚀
